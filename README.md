# ü¶† Microorganism Detection and Classification in Soil

This project presents a complete deep learning pipeline for the detection and classification of soil microorganisms using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. It combines object detection with YOLOv11 and image classification using a variety of CNN-based architectures to automate the analysis of microscopic soil images.

## üìå Project Overview

Manual identification of microbes in soil is time-consuming and error-prone. This project leverages deep learning to automate microbe detection and classification from microscopy images. The pipeline is divided into two stages:

1. Object Detection using YOLOv11 to localize microbes.  
2. Classification of cropped microbes using multiple CNN models including:
   - ResNet18
   - VGG16
   - AlexNet (Baseline)
   - Custom CNNs (No Dropout, With Dropout, With Attention)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Workflow

1. Preprocess dataset (augmentation, noise, balancing)  
2. Annotate and train YOLOv11 for detection  
3. Crop detected regions  
4. Train CNN models for classification using cropped images  
5. Evaluate models using accuracy and F1 scores
